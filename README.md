# WclPlayerScore
Wcl Player Score, Only Support CN region now.    

 

The people in my guild  want to see if the other player has Ahn'Qiraj experience when they are grouped,

and then I make this addon. It grab all player score from Warcraft Logs and display in player tool tips.

 

No options and little memory usage (one server occupies less than 1M, not load other servers

 

The function is on the character tips, /who name, right click on the avatar.

Wcl score will be displayed, and the color is your  score color

 

PS0: The score is defined as ALLSTAR Point plus percentage
PS1: It will update daily
